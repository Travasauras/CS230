Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Draw It Or Lose It was a client of The Gaming Room, they tasked us with a request to create a cross platform solution for their game that was currently only available on one platform.  This entailed designing a web-based server that could handle all of user info,
storage, and source code of the game.    

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a decent job in recommending which type of server operating system to use giving a fair rationale of how they work on said operating system.  I applied feedback from my instructor to previous mistakes and also applied knowledge learned within the course materials.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found that the design document helped in the code design, specifically the UML. It laid out the specifics and gave me a template to create a functioning OOP program. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the entire project, but only after learning more about operating systems and implementing cross platform functionality first hand.  Reading materials and hypothetical coding can only teach you so much, I have learned that repetitive first hand experience
is really the best way to learn something.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I considered the user's needs and weighed them against my design constraints.  In doing so I designed a cross platform program that met the clients needs.  Considering the user needs is essential in developing software that reflects the customers needs.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I made considerations based on user needs and design constraints.  In the future when developing, especially with a team, I would use the agile methods and SCRUM meetings to design a product that reflects a customer's needs as well as collaborative input from developers
users to ultimately create a product that makes the user happy as well as being designed well.
